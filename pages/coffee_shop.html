Description:
A full-stack web application built with Django that simulates an online coffee shop. The project demonstrates core web development concepts such as authentication, product management, and order handling, while also exposing a REST API for integration.

Features:

🔐 User authentication (login, logout, registration).

📦 Product catalog with images, prices, and availability.

🛒 Order system to add products to cart and place orders.

🎨 Responsive forms and UI styled with Crispy Forms + Tailwind CSS.

⚡ REST API powered by Django REST Framework (DRF).

🗄️ Database integration with PostgreSQL (production) and SQLite (development).

⚙️ Environment variable management with django-environ.

Tech stack:

Backend: Django 4, Django REST Framework

Frontend: Django templates, Tailwind CSS (Crispy Forms)

Database: PostgreSQL (prod), SQLite (dev)

Deployment ready: AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Purpose:
This project was developed as part of a Django course and later enhanced for my portfolio. It shows my ability to structure a Django project into reusable apps (products, orders, users), integrate frontend and backend logic, and prepare a project for both local development and deployment.
